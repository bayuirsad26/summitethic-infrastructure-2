## Ethical Principles

SummitEthic is committed to operating with the highest ethical standards. All infrastructure contributions should align with these core principles:

1. **Privacy**: Respect user privacy and data protection
2. **Transparency**: Create systems that are understandable and explainable
3. **Fairness**: Ensure equitable access and treatment for all users
4. **Sustainability**: Design for resource efficiency and minimal environmental impact

6. **Accessibility**: Make systems usable by people of all abilities

Before submitting any contribution, please consider its ethical implications and alignment with these principles.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This includes:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what's best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Ansible 2.12+
- Terraform 1.2+
- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/summitethic-infrastructure.git`
3. Add the upstream repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/summitethic/summitethic-infrastructure.git`
4. Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
5. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Development Workflow

We follow a trunk-based development workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes, following our coding standards and ethical principles
3. Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages
4. Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows our coding standards and ethical principles
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Include tests for new features or bug fixes
4. Fill out the pull request template completely
5. Request review from at least one maintainer
6. Address review comments promptly
7. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic or design decisions

### Ansible

- Follow [Ansible Best Practices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html)
- Use role-based organization
- Set `no_log: true` for tasks with sensitive information
- Use tags for task categorization
- Keep playbooks idempotent

### Terraform

- Follow [Terraform Best Practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/)
- Use modules for reusable components
- Include proper documentation for modules
- Use variables and locals for reusable values
- Include ethical tags in resource definitions

### Shell Scripts

- Use ShellCheck for linting
- Include proper error handling
- Include helpful usage information
- Make scripts executable and use proper shebang lines

## Documentation

Documentation is a critical part of our infrastructure. Please ensure:

- All roles, playbooks, and modules are documented
- READMEs are kept up-to-date
- Code includes comments explaining "why", not just "what"
- Architecture decisions are documented in `docs/architecture`
- Operational procedures are documented in `docs/operations`

## Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

- Ansible roles should include Molecule tests
- Terraform modules should include example configurations
- Scripts should include functional tests
- Security-critical components should include security tests

Run tests locally before submitting a pull request:

```bash
# Ansible tests
cd ansible
molecule test -s default

# Terraform validation
cd terraform
terraform validate

# Pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Security

Security is a top priority for SummitEthic:

- Never commit sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Use Ansible Vault for secrets
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Enable proper logging and audit trails
- Document security considerations
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to security@summitethic.com
