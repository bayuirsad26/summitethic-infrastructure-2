# SummitEthic Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for SummitEthic infrastructure and applications. It describes our Git workflow, code review process, and CI/CD pipeline.

## Git Workflow

We follow a trunk-based development workflow with short-lived feature branches:

### Branch Naming Convention

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/[ticket-number]-[short-description]`: Feature development
- `bugfix/[ticket-number]-[short-description]`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/[ticket-number]-[short-description]`: Urgent production fixes
- `docs/[ticket-number]-[short-description]`: Documentation changes

### Development Process

1. Create a new branch from `main` for your task
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Push your branch regularly to remote
4. Create a pull request when the feature is ready for review
5. After approval and passing CI checks, merge to `main`
6. Delete the feature branch after merging

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code functionality
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- `ethical`: Changes related to ethical considerations

Example:

```
feat(api): add rate limiting for ethical resource use

Implements rate limiting on the API to ensure fair resource distribution
and prevent denial of service conditions.

Relates to: #123
```

## Code Review Process

### Review Criteria

All code changes must be reviewed against these criteria:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Quality**: Is the code well-structured and maintainable?
3. **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
4. **Performance**: Is the code efficient and optimized?
5. **Ethics**: Does the code align with our ethical principles?
6. **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?
7. **Tests**: Are there appropriate tests for the changes?

### Review Process

1. Submit a pull request via GitHub
2. Assign at least one reviewer (two for critical systems)
3. Automated CI checks must pass
4. Address all reviewer comments
5. Obtain approval from all required reviewers
6. Merge when all criteria are met

### Ethical Review Checklist

For each pull request, consider these ethical aspects:

- [ ] Does the change respect user privacy?
- [ ] Is it accessible to users with disabilities?
- [ ] Does it treat all users fairly?
- [ ] Is resource usage proportionate and efficient?
- [ ] Does it maintain or improve system security?
- [ ] Is it transparent in its operation?
- [ ] Could it have unintended negative consequences?

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

All code pushes and pull requests trigger automated checks:

1. **Linting**: Code style and formatting
2. **Static Analysis**: Security and code quality scans
3. **Unit Tests**: Automated testing of code components
4. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components

### Continuous Deployment

Our deployment process follows these stages:

1. **Development**: Automatic deployment to dev environment on merge to `main`
2. **Staging**: Scheduled or manual promotion from dev
3. **Production**: Manual approval and promotion from staging

### Pipeline Security

To ensure the security of our CI/CD pipeline:

1. Secrets are managed via secure mechanisms (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets)
2. Build artifacts are scanned for vulnerabilities
3. Infrastructure as Code is validated before deployment
4. All deployments are logged and auditable
5. Role-based access controls limit deployment permissions

## Testing Strategy

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Security Tests**: Identify security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure system meets performance requirements
- **Accessibility Tests**: Verify system is accessible to all users

### Test Environments

- **Development**: For developer testing
- **Staging**: Mirror of production for final verification
- **Production**: Live environment

## Release Process

### Release Planning

1. Create a release plan with features, fixes, and dependencies
2. Schedule the release with relevant stakeholders
3. Prepare release documentation
4. Conduct pre-release testing

### Release Execution

1. Merge release branch to `main`
2. Monitor deployment to staging
3. Conduct final verification tests
4. Approve production deployment
5. Monitor production deployment
6. Tag release in Git with version number

### Post-Release

1. Conduct post-release review
2. Document any issues or learnings
3. Update documentation if necessary
4. Plan improvements for future releases

## Documentation

All development work must include appropriate documentation:

- Code comments for complex logic
- README files for repositories
- API documentation for interfaces
- Architecture documentation for system design
- User documentation for end-users

## Ethical Development Principles

Our development workflow incorporates these ethical principles:

1. **Privacy by Design**: Consider privacy implications from the start
2. **Accessibility First**: Design for accessibility from the beginning
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for minimal resource usage
4. **Security Focus**: Build security into every aspect
5. **Transparency**: Document how systems work and process data
6. **Fairness**: Ensure systems treat all users equitably
7. **Environmental Consideration**: Minimize environmental impact

## Tools and Resources

- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Issue Tracking**: Jira
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: Markdown in Git, Confluence
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams
