# SummitEthic Deployment Procedures

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the SummitEthic infrastructure. It covers initial setup, regular deployments, and emergency procedures.

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:

- Access credentials to target environments
- Ansible installed locally (version 2.12+)
- Terraform installed locally (version 1.2+)
- SSH key access to infrastructure servers
- VPN access to infrastructure network (if required)
- Access to the SummitEthic Git repositories

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Infrastructure Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/summitethic/summitethic-infrastructure.git
cd summitethic-infrastructure
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
make install
```

### 3. Configure Vault Password

Create a vault password file that will be used to decrypt sensitive information:

```bash
echo "your-secure-vault-password" > .vault_pass
chmod 600 .vault_pass
```

## Deployment Process

SummitEthic follows a staged deployment process across environments:

1. **Development**: Continuous integration with automated testing
2. **Staging**: Pre-production validation
3. **Production**: Controlled production release

### Development Deployment

Development deployments are typically automated via CI/CD but can be triggered manually:

```bash
make deploy ENV=development
```

For partial deployments:

```bash
make deploy-core ENV=development     # Deploy core infrastructure only
make deploy-services ENV=development  # Deploy services only
make deploy-platform ENV=development  # Deploy platform only
```

### Staging Deployment

Staging deployments require successful testing in development:

1. Verify development environment is stable
2. Run pre-deployment checks

```bash
make security-check
make ethical-check
```

3. Deploy to staging

```bash
make deploy ENV=staging
```

4. Validate deployment

```bash
make security-audit ENV=staging
```

### Production Deployment

Production deployments require additional approval and coordination:

1. Schedule deployment during low-traffic hours
2. Notify relevant stakeholders
3. Run pre-deployment checks

```bash
make security-check
make ethical-check
```

4. Create a backup before deployment

```bash
make backup ENV=production
```

5. Deploy to production

```bash
make deploy ENV=production
```

6. Validate deployment

```bash
make security-audit ENV=production
make ethical-audit ENV=production
```

## Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning

For cloud infrastructure provisioning with Terraform:

### 1. Initialize Terraform

```bash
make tf-plan ENV=target-environment
```

### 2. Review the Plan

Carefully review the Terraform plan output to understand what resources will be created, modified, or destroyed.

### 3. Apply the Changes

```bash
make tf-apply ENV=target-environment
```

## Component-Specific Deployments

### Web Servers

To deploy or update web servers only:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/ENV/inventory.yml ansible/playbooks/site.yml --tags web --limit web_servers
```

### Database Servers

To deploy or update database servers only:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/ENV/inventory.yml ansible/playbooks/database.yml
```

### Adding a New Website

To add a new website to the platform:

```bash
ansible/scripts/create-website.sh --environment ENV example.com
```

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment issues, follow these rollback procedures:

### 1. Identify the Issue

Determine the nature and scope of the issue before proceeding with rollback.

### 2. Application Rollback

For application-level issues:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventories/ENV/inventory.yml ansible/playbooks/rollback.yml -e "version=PREVIOUS_VERSION"
```

### 3. Infrastructure Rollback

For infrastructure-level issues:

```bash
cd terraform/environments/ENV
terraform apply -target=RESOURCE -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

### 4. Complete Rollback

In case of critical failure:

```bash
make deploy ENV=production -e "version=PREVIOUS_VERSION"
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

After successful deployment:

1. Verify all services are operational
2. Run security scan: `make security-audit ENV=ENV_NAME`
3. Run ethical assessment: `make ethical-audit ENV=ENV_NAME`
4. Update deployment documentation
5. Notify stakeholders of completed deployment

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during deployment:

1. Check logs: `ansible/inventories/ENV/logs/`
2. Verify connectivity to all hosts
3. Ensure vault password is correct
4. Validate inventory file for the environment
5. Check for disk space issues on target hosts

## Ethical Considerations

All deployments must adhere to SummitEthic's ethical guidelines:

- Deployments should be scheduled to minimize user impact
- Data migrations must preserve user privacy
- Resource utilization should be monitored to prevent waste
- Security patches should be prioritized based on risk assessment
- All deployment actions should be logged for accountability

## Support and Escalation

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Development issues: Contact the DevOps team
2. Infrastructure issues: Contact the Infrastructure team
3. Security concerns: Contact the Security team immediately
4. After-hours emergencies: Use the on-call rotation
