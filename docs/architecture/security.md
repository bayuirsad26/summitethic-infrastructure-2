# SummitEthic Security Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the security architecture of the SummitEthic infrastructure, implementing a defense-in-depth strategy that aligns with our ethical principles.

## Security Principles

Our security architecture is built on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls throughout the infrastructure
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Access limited to the minimum necessary permissions
3. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from the beginning, not added afterward
4. **Privacy Preservation**: Security measures respect user privacy and data rights
5. **Transparency**: Clear documentation and open communication about security practices
6. **Ethical Considerations**: Security measures implemented with consideration of broader impacts

## Infrastructure Security Layers

### Network Security

- **VPC Segmentation**: Isolated network segments for different workloads
- **Security Groups**: Fine-grained access controls between services
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall protecting public-facing services
- **DDoS Protection**: Mitigation of distributed denial-of-service attacks
- **Secure Transit**: TLS for all data in transit

### Host Security

- **OS Hardening**: CIS-compliant OS configurations
- **Patch Management**: Automated security updates
- **Host Firewalls**: UFW/iptables configured with default-deny policies
- **Rootkit Detection**: Regular scans for unauthorized system modifications
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: AIDE monitoring for unauthorized changes

### Application Security

- **Container Security**: Minimal base images, non-root users, read-only filesystems
- **Dependency Management**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **SAST/DAST**: Static and dynamic application security testing
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and proper authentication
- **Secure Development**: Developer training and secure coding practices

### Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted on disk
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS for all communications
- **Data Minimization**: Collection of only necessary data
- **Secure Key Management**: Proper handling of encryption keys
- **Data Classification**: Policies and controls based on data sensitivity

### Identity and Access Management

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: For all administrative access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Principle of least privilege implementation
- **Centralized Identity**: Single source of truth for user management
- **Automated Provisioning/Deprovisioning**: Timely access management
- **Password Policies**: Strong password requirements and regular rotation

### Monitoring and Response

- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregation of all security-relevant logs
- **SIEM Integration**: Security information and event management
- **Intrusion Detection**: Network and host-based detection systems
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and remediation
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents

## Implementation Details

### Network Security Implementation

The network security implementation uses AWS security groups, NACLs, and VPC design to create isolated segments:

- **Public Subnets**: Only contain load balancers and bastion hosts
- **Application Subnets**: Web and application servers, isolated from direct internet access
- **Data Subnets**: Databases and storage systems, isolated from public access
- **Management Subnets**: Monitoring and administrative systems

All traffic between these segments is explicitly controlled by security groups, following the principle of least privilege.

### Host Hardening

Host hardening follows the CIS benchmarks and includes:

- Removal of unnecessary packages and services
- Secure configuration of SSH (no password authentication, no root login)
- Strong user password policies
- File system access controls
- Kernel hardening (sysctls for network, memory, and process security)
- Regular security updates

### Container Security

Container security is implemented through:

- Minimal base images to reduce attack surface
- Non-root container users
- Read-only file systems where possible
- Resource limits to prevent DoS conditions
- No privileged containers
- Regular image scanning for vulnerabilities

### Secrets Management

Secrets are managed through:

- Ansible Vault for configuration-time secrets
- Environment variables for runtime secrets in containers
- Short-lived credentials where possible
- Regular credential rotation
- Audit logging of secrets access

## Ethical Considerations

Our security implementation incorporates ethical considerations such as:

1. **Privacy Respecting**: Security controls that don't unnecessarily invade privacy
2. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of security measures
3. **Proportionality**: Security controls proportional to actual risk
4. **Resource Fairness**: Security measures that don't unfairly consume resources
5. **Accessibility**: Security that doesn't unnecessarily impede legitimate access

## Regular Assessment

The security architecture is regularly assessed through:

- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Compliance audits
- Threat modeling for new features and services

## Security Responsibilities

Security is a shared responsibility:

- **Development Team**: Secure coding, vulnerability remediation
- **Operations Team**: Secure configuration, patching, monitoring
- **Security Team**: Policy, assessment, incident response
- **Management**: Risk decisions, resource allocation
- **All Staff**: Security awareness, policy compliance
