# SummitEthic Network Architecture

## Overview

This document details the network architecture of SummitEthic's infrastructure, including segmentation, traffic flow, security controls, and ethical design considerations.

## Design Principles

The network architecture of SummitEthic follows these key principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of network security
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal network access between components
3. **Segmentation**: Logical separation of different workloads
4. **Privacy by Design**: Data flows designed with privacy in mind
5. **Redundancy**: Elimination of single points of failure
6. **Scalability**: Ability to grow without architectural changes
7. **Observability**: Comprehensive network monitoring

## Network Topology

### VPC and Subnetting

SummitEthic's infrastructure is deployed across multiple AWS availability zones in a single region with the following structure:

| Environment | VPC CIDR    | Purpose                   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Development | 10.0.0.0/16 | Development and testing   |
| Staging     | 10.1.0.0/16 | Pre-production validation |
| Production  | 10.2.0.0/16 | Production workloads      |

Each VPC is divided into the following subnet types:

| Subnet Type | CIDR Range  | Purpose                               |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Public      | x.x.0.0/20  | Internet-facing load balancers        |
| Private App | x.x.16.0/20 | Application servers                   |
| Private DB  | x.x.32.0/20 | Database servers                      |
| Management  | x.x.48.0/20 | Monitoring and administrative systems |

### Network Connectivity

#### Internet Connectivity

- **Public Subnets**: Have direct routes to the internet via Internet Gateway
- **Private Subnets**: Access internet via NAT Gateways in public subnets
- **VPC Endpoints**: Used for AWS service access without traversing the internet

#### VPC-to-VPC Connectivity

- **Transit Gateway**: Connects development, staging, and production VPCs
- **Route Tables**: Controlled routing between VPCs
- **NACLs**: Additional subnet-level filtering between VPCs

#### On-Premises Connectivity

- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects corporate network to AWS infrastructure
- **AWS Direct Connect**: High-bandwidth, low-latency connection (Production only)

## Traffic Flow

### External Traffic

1. User requests enter through internet-facing Application Load Balancers in public subnets
2. ALBs terminate TLS and route traffic to application servers in private subnets
3. Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects against common web exploits
4. CloudFront CDN distributes static content from S3 buckets

### Internal Traffic

1. Application servers in private subnets call databases in database subnets
2. Service-to-service communication occurs over private subnets
3. Management and monitoring traffic is isolated to management subnets
4. Data processing follows ethical pathways with minimized lateral movement

## Security Controls

### Perimeter Security

- **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection for public endpoints
- **Web Application Firewall**: Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Security Groups**: Stateful firewall rules for EC2 instances
- **Network ACLs**: Stateless subnet-level firewall rules

### Segmentation Controls

- **Security Groups**: Instance-level access controls
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet boundary controls
- **Transit Gateway Route Tables**: Control inter-VPC traffic
- **IAM Policies**: Service-level access controls

### Monitoring and Detection

- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic logging
- **CloudWatch**: Network traffic metrics
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection service
- **Network Packet Inspection**: For east-west traffic monitoring

## Ethical Network Design

SummitEthic's network architecture incorporates ethical considerations in the following ways:

### Privacy Protection

- **Minimized Data Collection**: Network monitoring collects only necessary metadata
- **Privacy-Preserving Routing**: Data flows designed to minimize exposure
- **Secure Transit**: All data in transit is encrypted
- **Data Boundaries**: Network controls enforce data locality requirements

### Fair Resource Allocation

- **QoS Policies**: Ensure fair bandwidth allocation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent resource monopolization
- **Burst Handling**: Accommodate legitimate traffic spikes
- **Prioritization**: Critical services given appropriate priority without starving others

### Sustainable Design

- **Efficient Routing**: Optimized paths to reduce network hops
- **Right-sized Infrastructure**: Appropriate provisioning to reduce waste
- **Traffic Optimization**: Caching and compression to reduce bandwidth usage
- **Regional Proximity**: Services deployed close to users to reduce latency and transit costs

## Implementation Details

### AWS Network Components

- **Internet Gateway**: Provides internet access to public subnets
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables private subnets to access internet
- **Transit Gateway**: Central hub for VPC-to-VPC and VPC-to-on-premises connectivity
- **VPC Endpoints**: Private connections to AWS services
- **Route Tables**: Control traffic routing within VPCs
- **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level stateless firewall rules
- **Security Groups**: Instance-level stateful firewall rules
- **Elastic Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic to application instances

### Routing and Network Policies

```hcl
# Example route table configuration for private app subnets
resource "aws_route_table" "private_app" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.main.id
  }

  route {
    cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"  # Staging VPC
    transit_gateway_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.main.id
  }

  route {
    cidr_block = "10.2.0.0/16"  # Production VPC
    transit_gateway_id = aws_ec2_transit_gateway.main.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "private-app-route-table"
    Environment = var.environment
    "org.summitethic.component" = "route-table"
    "org.summitethic.purpose" = "private-routing"
  }
}
```

## IP Address Management

SummitEthic uses a structured IP addressing scheme to ensure consistency and scalability:

| Purpose             | CIDR Allocation                          | Notes                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| VPC Infrastructure  | 10.x.0.0/20                              | Reserved for VPC services |
| Public Subnets      | 10.x.0.0/22, 10.x.4.0/22, 10.x.8.0/22    | 3 AZs                     |
| Private App Subnets | 10.x.16.0/22, 10.x.20.0/22, 10.x.24.0/22 | 3 AZs                     |
| Private DB Subnets  | 10.x.32.0/22, 10.x.36.0/22, 10.x.40.0/22 | 3 AZs                     |
| Management Subnets  | 10.x.48.0/22, 10.x.52.0/22, 10.x.56.0/22 | 3 AZs                     |
| Future Expansion    | 10.x.64.0/18                             | Reserved for growth       |
