# SummitEthic Logging System Ethical Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines the ethical considerations incorporated into the SummitEthic logging infrastructure.

## Data Collection Principles

1. **Minimal Collection**: We only collect log data that serves a legitimate operational purpose.
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Log data is only used for the specified purposes of:
   - System troubleshooting and debugging
   - Security monitoring and incident response
   - Performance optimization
   - Compliance requirements

3. **Data Retention**: All logs are subject to the following retention policies:
   - System logs: {{ system_log_retention_days | default(30) }} days
   - Security logs: {{ security_log_retention_days | default(90) }} days
   - Application logs: {{ app_log_retention_days | default(30) }} days

## Privacy Protection

1. **PII Handling**:
   - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is automatically redacted or anonymized
   - IP addresses are partially anonymized by default
   - User identifiers are hashed where possible

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Access to log data is strictly limited to authorized personnel
   - All access is authenticated, authorized, and audited
   - Role-based access control is implemented

## Transparency

1. **Documentation**:
   - All log collection is documented in this file and related configuration
   - Log formats and fields are documented
   - Retention policies are clearly defined and automatically enforced

2. **Ethical Use Statement**:
   We commit to using logging data only for legitimate operational purposes and never for:
   - Employee surveillance beyond security requirements
   - Discriminatory practices
   - Selling or sharing with third parties without explicit justification

## Implementation

This ethical framework is implemented through:
- Data field filtering in Logstash pipelines
- Anonymization processors in Filebeat
- Automated data retention policies in Elasticsearch
- Role-based access control in Kibana

## Responsible Persons

- Data Owner: {{ logging_data_owner | default('Chief Technology Officer') }}
- System Administrator: {{ logging_administrator | default('DevOps Team') }}
- Privacy Contact: {{ privacy_contact | default('privacy@summitethic.com') }}
