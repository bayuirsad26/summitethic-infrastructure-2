# SummitEthic Ethical Analytics Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the ethical principles and practices implemented in the SummitEthic analytics platform.

## Privacy-First Analytics

Our analytics implementation prioritizes user privacy through:

1. **Cookieless Tracking**: We use {{ analytics_type }} which does not rely on cookies for tracking.
2. **No Personal Data Collection**: We do not collect or store personally identifiable information.
3. **IP Anonymization**: All IP addresses are anonymized before storage.
4. **Limited Data Retention**: Data is only retained for {{ analytics_retention_days | default(90) }} days.
5. **No Cross-Site Tracking**: Analytics are strictly limited to our own domains.
6. **No Data Sharing**: Analytics data is not shared with third parties.

## Transparency

We maintain transparency about our analytics practices:

1. **Clear Privacy Policy**: A comprehensive privacy policy explains our data practices.
2. **Opt-Out Mechanisms**: Users can easily opt out of all analytics tracking.
3. **Data Access**: Summary analytics data is available to relevant stakeholders.
4. **Purpose Limitation**: Data is used only for improving user experience and site performance.

## Ethical Data Usage

Analytics data is used ethically according to these principles:

1. **Non-Discriminatory Use**: Data is never used to discriminate against users.
2. **No Manipulative Design**: Insights are not used to implement dark patterns.
3. **Aggregate Analysis**: Analysis focuses on aggregate trends, not individual behavior.
4. **Respectful Decision-Making**: Business decisions based on analytics respect user autonomy.

## Technical Implementation

Our ethical stance is implemented through:

1. **{{ analytics_type | title }} Analytics**: A privacy-focused analytics platform.
2. **Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: Data remains within our control at all times.
3. **Minimal Script Weight**: Analytics scripts are lightweight and don't impact page performance.
4. **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular ethical audits of our analytics practices.
