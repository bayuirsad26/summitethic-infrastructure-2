# SummitEthic Ethical Communication Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the ethical principles and implementation details of the SummitEthic team communication platform based on Mattermost.

## Core Principles

### 1. Privacy-Respecting Communication

Our team communication system prioritizes privacy through:

- End-to-end encryption options for sensitive conversations
- Local data storage with organizational control
- Minimal metadata collection and retention
- No content monitoring or analysis for non-security purposes
- Transparent handling of all communication data

### 2. Inclusive and Respectful Environment

We foster a healthy communication environment by:

- Providing accessibility features for all team members
- Enabling safe reporting mechanisms for inappropriate content
- Supporting diverse communication styles and preferences
- Facilitating asynchronous communication for work-life balance
- Encouraging transparent but respectful communication

### 3. Fair and Sustainable Resource Use

Communication resources are allocated fairly through:

- Efficient message storage and transmission
- Reasonable file sharing quotas
- Optimized mobile and desktop clients
- Sustainable data retention policies
- Local hosting to reduce network impact

### 4. Data Sovereignty and Control

Your organization maintains control of communication data by:

- Self-hosting all communication infrastructure
- Implementing configurable retention policies
- Providing data export capabilities
- Ensuring no vendor lock-in
- Maintaining complete audit capabilities

## Technical Implementation
