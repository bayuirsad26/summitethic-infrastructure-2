# SummitEthic Ethical Authentication Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the ethical principles and implementation details of the SummitEthic authentication system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Privacy-Respecting Authentication

Our Single Sign-On system is designed with privacy as a foundational principle:

- Minimizes data collection to only what is necessary for authentication
- Stores user data securely with encryption at rest
- Does not track user behavior beyond authentication events
- Provides clear visibility to users about what data is stored
- Implements automatic data pruning after {{ sso_data_retention_days | default(365) }} days of inactivity

### 2. Security-First Design

Security measures are comprehensive and proportionate:

- Multi-factor authentication options for all users
- Brute force protection with account lockouts
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Secure password policies with minimum complexity requirements
- Secure credential storage using industry best practices

### 3. User Autonomy and Control

Users maintain control over their identity information:

- Self-service account management
- Ability to download or delete personal data
- Transparent consent for data usage
- Revocable access for connected applications
- Clear authentication events history

### 4. Accessibility and Inclusion

The authentication system is designed to be accessible to all:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all authentication interfaces
- Multiple authentication methods for diverse user needs
- Support for assistive technologies
- Language options for international users
- Support for various devices and connection speeds

### 5. Transparency

Our authentication processes are transparent and explainable:

- Clear documentation of authentication flows
- Explanations of security measures in place
- Notification of authentication events to users
- Regular reports on authentication system performance
- Clear error messages that guide without revealing sensitive information

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flows

The system supports these authentication methods:
- Username and password
- Email verification
- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless authentication
- Social identity providers (with privacy protections)

### Data Protection

User data is protected through:
- Encryption of all personally identifiable information
- Secure hashing of credentials
- Isolated database environments
- Regular backups with encryption
- Strict access controls for administrators

### Monitoring and Audit

For security and ethical compliance, we monitor:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Account lockouts and suspicious activities
- Administrator actions on user accounts
- System performance and resource usage
- API access patterns

### Responsible Disclosure

We maintain a responsible disclosure program for security researchers who identify vulnerabilities in our authentication system.
