# SummitEthic Ethical Monitoring Policy

# Ethical monitoring principles
principles:
  - principle: "data_minimization"
    description: "Collect only necessary metrics, no personal data"
    implementation:
      - "Filtered metrics to exclude PII"
      - "Limited retention periods for all data"
      - "Anonymization of access logs"
      
  - principle: "fair_resource_monitoring"
    description: "Monitor resources to ensure fair allocation"
    implementation:
      - "Track resource usage by tenant/user"
      - "Alert on resource monopolization"
      - "Provide transparency on resource allocation"
      
  - principle: "privacy_respecting"
    description: "Monitoring respects user and system privacy"
    implementation:
      - "No content monitoring of user communications"
      - "No tracking of personal browsing habits"
      - "No monitoring of user-specific behavior"
      
  - principle: "secure_monitoring"
    description: "Monitoring infrastructure is secure"
    implementation:
      - "Encrypted metric transmission"
      - "Access controls on monitoring tools"
      - "Regular security reviews of monitoring stack"
      
  - principle: "transparency"
    description: "Monitoring is transparent to users"
    implementation:
      - "Documentation of all monitored metrics"
      - "Clear disclosure of monitoring capabilities"
      - "Accessible explanation of alert thresholds"
